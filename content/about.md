Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Justin Barksdale, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.

## Personal Information

I live with my wife Shannon and our six kids in the Pittsburgh, PA area. I enjoy camping and fishing with my family in my spare time when I am not working. I also enjoy playing golf when I am able.

## Professional Information

I’ve been in the Information Technology field for more than 15 years, starting as a help desk support technician. I have worked as a field engineer for a large service provider and a solutions architect for a small VAR in the local area, where I was also a practice lead in their Communications Division. Since joining Cisco in 2014, I have been a Systems Engineer covering some of the largest Universities in Pennsylvania, a Technical Solutions Architect supporting Enterprise customers in Northern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania focused on Data Center and Cloud Technologies.  In my current role, I am a Technical Leader in the Office of the CTO for the Cloud and Compute Business Unit.  This position allows me to look forward to where our industry is going and who we should partner/invest/acquire to help us continue to innovate.
