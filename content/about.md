Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Justin Barksdale, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.

## Personal Information

I live with my wife Shannon and our six kids in the Pittsburgh, PA area. I enjoy camping and fishing with my family in my spare time when I am not working. I also enjoy playing golf when I am able.

## Professional Information

I’ve been in the Information Technology field for more than 15 years, starting as a help desk support technician. I have worked as a field engineer for a large service provider and a solutions architect for a small VAR in the local area, where I was also a practice lead in their Communications Division. I recently joined Spectro Cloud as a Senior Solutions Architect and prior to Spectro Cloud, I was a Technical Marketing Engineer at Cisco Systems.  In my current role, I am a Technical Leader focused on helping customers navigate the challenges of adopting Kubernetes in their application environments.
